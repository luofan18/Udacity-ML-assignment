Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",

The feature which are positively relavant to the prediction are assigned positive weight and nagetively relevant to the prediction are assigned negative weight.
